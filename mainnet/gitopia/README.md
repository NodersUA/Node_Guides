### About project <a href="#y32n" id="y32n"></a>

Gitopia is a next-generation code collaboration platform based on a decentralized network and an interactive token economy. It is designed to streamline the open source software development process through collaboration, transparency, and incentives.\
It's basically GitHub, only on the blockchain and with its own token.

Gitopia is a platform for developers and web3 communities to collaborate on open-source projects in a decentralized and censorship-free environment by using permanent storage through Filecoin, Arweave, and IPFS. Additionally, it offers web3-specific features such as Bounties and Proposals, which Gitopia supports through its native LORE token, as well as familiar collaboration tools like Issues and Pull-Requests.
