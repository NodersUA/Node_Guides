OJO is an IBC-native decentralized price oracle incubated by Umee, created for all IBC assets. It offers **secure and robust interchain communication for accurate price data** from various authenticated centralized and decentralized data sources.

OJO is built **with a distributed set of validators to collect and aggregate accurate price data in real time**. The OJO price oracle supports any and all IBC assets, updating prices at native speed within the Cosmos ecosystem.

OJO uses cryptographic proofs and off-chain commit-reveal schema to generate the most reliable on-chain data. OJO starts off by being the highest performing price oracle but its use cases go beyond price data and also include interchain proofs, status verification updates, and much more.
