5ireChain is an EVM-compatible sustainability-oriented smart contract platform that focuses on developing a sustainable and for-benefit ecosystem based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) .To enable this, our goal is to build a computing platform that promotes and advocates these activities to achieve the goals.

5ire is a layer-1 blockchain ecosystem designed with economic and environmental sustainability at its core and is one of India's fastest-growing unicorns, enabled by a community of people worldwide.

5ireChain highlights many building blocks that can be combined to further create tools and schemes that can help make the shift from the fourth industrial revolution to the fifth. 5ire, thus, invites stakeholders, developers, legacy agencies, and users to be creative in how they utilize 5ireChain and interact with its ecosystem.
