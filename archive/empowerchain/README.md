### What is EmpowerChain? <a href="#what-is-empowerchain-1" id="what-is-empowerchain-1"></a>

EmpowerChain is an innovative, tailored blockchain network designed to support the circular economy and promote equal opportunities for stakeholders in the global decentralized waste management ecosystem. EmpowerChain enables various parties to collaborate and create sustainable solutions for our planet's waste management challenges by providing a trustless and lock-in-free platform.

### How does EmpowerChain work?[​](https://docs.empowerchain.io/introduction/what-is-empowerchain#how-does-empowerchain-work) <a href="#how-does-empowerchain-work" id="how-does-empowerchain-work"></a>

EmpowerChain works on providing tools and infrastructure needed for circular economy to work.

EmpowerChain consists of a series of interconnected applications and tools that incentivize and facilitate collaboration between stakeholders, such as waste collectors, manufacturers, and impact investors. Some of the initial and planned applications include:

1. Tracking: Proof of existence – Ensuring the traceability of waste through the use of blockchain's immutability and cryptographic techniques called "hashing."
2. Plastic Credits – Incentives for collection organizations, sorting facilities, and recyclers to efficiently collect and process waste materials.
3. Collection incentive schemes – Establishing bespoke deposit systems for organizations or individuals to collect and recycle waste materials or products.
