Cascadia is a Layer-1 blockchain built to explore the nature of incentives on network effects, starting with ve-tokenomics.&#x20;

Cascadia proposes a novel approach–that through the adoption of cybernetics, symbiotic relationships can be formed between ordinarily incompatible parties on a blockchain network.

Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary branch of mathematics studying the behavior of dynamic systems. At the core of cybernetics is the concept of circular causality or feedback; stated simply, observed outcomes are taken as inputs for further action in the same system. Cascadia will integrate two feedback loops which allow for growth and adaptation. One loop makes adjustments based on observation of the system’s output, enabling learning. The other recognizes environmental changes and replaces obsolete information in the system with new data, enabling evolution.

The end goal is a fully autonomous blockchain.
