### About project <a href="#y32n" id="y32n"></a>

DeFund Finance: A dedicated blockchain for one application is to help crypto-enthusiasts grow their wealth over time. DeFund allows you to create decentralized exchange-traded funds (officially called dETFs) with underlying assets from dozens and dozens of blockchains (and growing rapidly). Once a dETF is created, any DeFund user can invest in any of the suggested created dETFs, such as the top 20 cryptocurrency index on Coinmarketcap.
