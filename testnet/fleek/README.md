Fleek is a development platform that lets you leave your noggin at home. Manage development & deployments of your app's frontend to decentralized networks like IPFS, the Internet Computer, and Filecoin (many more coming soon).

Vercel + Cloudflare + Web3 = Fleek

Goals Web3 isnâ€™t going to be a single stack world. Our goal is to provide unbiased accessibility to all of the possible combinations and permutations of the web3 infrastructure stack (hosting, storage, gateways, domains, CDN, compute, etc) without having to spend time diving deep into the nuances and complexities of integrating them yourself. You wire up your application to Fleek, we wire you up to your preferred web3 infra.
