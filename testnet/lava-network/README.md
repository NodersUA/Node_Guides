# Lava Network

Lava Network is a centralized RPC node dependency solution built on top of Cosmos and Tendermint. Lava Network creates a decentralized infrastructure layer for blockchain remote procedure calls, RPC - remote procedure calls. In essence, this is a peer-to-peer RPC network.

This solution will allow Web3 companies to eliminate dependence on centralized RPC nodes, which will reduce vulnerability and the likelihood of being compromised.
