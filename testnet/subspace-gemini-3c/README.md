Subspace Network is a network that allows developers to very easily and quickly deploy decentralized Web3 applications, which, in turn, can automatically scale as needed. Full integration with Polkadot & Kusama, in the near future with EVM. Subspace runs on a first-level blockchain designed to solve fundamental problems such as: ecology, centralization, and lack of scalability. These problems can be solved with a fresh implementation of proof-of-capacity (PoC). Analogues familiar to us on PoC: Chia, Spacemesh, Filecoin.
