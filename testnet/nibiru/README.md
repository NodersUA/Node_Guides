### About project <a href="#y32n" id="y32n"></a>

Nibiru Chain is a proof-of-stake blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem. Nibiru supports three main decentralized applications:\
Nibi-Perps - an open-ended exchange: on the exchange, users can use borrowed funds and trade many assets\
Nibi-Swap - Spot AMM: Automated Market Maker for Multichain Assets. This application provides users with access to swaps, pools and related liquidity indicators.\
NUSD Stablecoin uses a dual-token economic model, where NIBI is the governance and utility token for the protocol, and NUSD is the capital-efficient, partially collateralized algorithmic stablecoin created by the protocol\
Nibiru combines leveraged derivatives trading, spot trading, staking and bond liquidity into a single user interface, allowing users of more than 40 blockchains to trade leveraged using a set of decentralized, composable applications.
