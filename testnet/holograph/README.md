Holograph is a smart contract protocol that enables fungible and non-fungible tokens to move across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains, while maintaining a persistent smart contract address, token ID, and underlying data. In one particular embodiment, an exact bit-to-bit version of a digital assets is passed onto an EVM blockchain and combined with a specific set of rules and restrictions, enabling the asset to _beam_ freely among blockchains, while still maintaining its token attributes.

This is achieved by a patented process called _Holographing_ (U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/317,343 Systems and Methods for Managing Network-Agnostic Smart Contracts), which was inspired from the process of [_holography_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography), which is a technique in physics that “enables a wavefront to be recorded and later re-constructed.”

Holograph facilitates the use of a single, unique smart contract address and token ID across all blockchains, making them the definitive identifying characteristics of the token, while guaranteeing secure, non-fungible asset transfers between blockchains. By using a strictly enforced process, initial seeds are populated across blockchains, allowing for all subsequent smart contracts to be derived from them. With this approach, smart contract addresses are ensured to remain consistent no matter where they exist. The seeds allow for Holograph to synchronize and support all existing EVM blockchains, in addition to all future EVM blockchains.

Furthermore, Holograph expands this concept by utilizing _Holographers_, which operate in an isolated layer and enforce the universal standards of all types of digital assets. This creates a virtual machine-like environment inside of a blockchain, empowering developers to create and innovate freely, without compromising data integrity or universal token standards.
